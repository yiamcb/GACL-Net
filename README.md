GACL-Net: Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Accurate Motor Imagery Classification in Stroke Rehabilitation

This study proposes graph-attentive convolutional long short-term memory network (GACL-Net), a novel deep learning model for classifying motor imagery tasks in stroke patients using EEG data. The model combines multi-scale convolutional layers, attention mechanisms, and graph convolutional networks to address challenges like EEG pattern variability and overlapping neural signatures.
